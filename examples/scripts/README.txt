This folder contains the scripts necessary to create benchmark sequences to compare
the performance of methods for interpreting the results of trained CNN models for 
genomic sequences.

The main script in the folder is "controller.py". To configure this script to create 
benchmark sequences based on your own set of positive and negative sequences, the 
file that needs to be modified is "config.properties".

The script can be run using the command:
python controller.py
